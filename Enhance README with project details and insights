Complete Data Cleaning, Standardisation, ERD Design & Analysis using BigQuery

#  Overview  
This project demonstrates a **full end-to-end SQL workflow** on a Famous Paintings dataset using **Google BigQuery**.

It includes:
- Data Cleaning  
- Data Standardisation  
- Data Validation  
- Relationship Modelling  
- Entity–Relationship Diagram (ERD)  
- Advanced SQL Analytical Insights  
- GitHub Project Documentation

Cleaned tables include:

| Table Name                 | Purpose |
|----------------------------|---------|
| artist_cleaned            | Clean artist details, names, nationality |
| work_cleaned              | Artwork info, artist and museum link |
| museum_cleaned            | Normalised museum details, city/state/postal cleaning |
| museum_hours_cleaned      | Standardised opening hours |
| canvas_size_cleaned       | Standardised canvas dimensions |
| product_size_cleaned      | Prices linked to specific canvas sizes |
| image_link_cleaned        | Cleaned image URLs |
| subject_cleaned           | Cleaned painting subjects |

# Key Cleaning Techniques:
- Trim spaces (`TRIM`)
- Name formatting (`INITCAP`)
- Standardising casing (`LOWER`)
- Removing invalid numbers (`SAFE_CAST`)
- Removing duplicates (`ROW_NUMBER`)
- Normalising time formats
- Fixing city/state/postal inconsistencies
- Ensuring foreign key consistency
- Removing corrupted rows (like `#VALUE!`)



# Entity–Relationship Diagram (ERD)

This diagram shows the full relational database structure with all columns, PKs, and FKs.

# How to Run the Project

1. Open **Google BigQuery**
2. Run all SQL files in `cleaning_queries/` to generate cleaned tables.
3. Run any SQL file in `analysis_queries/` to get insights.
4. View the ERD to understand the relationships.
